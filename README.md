## üõ†Ô∏è Data Persistence

Sportex uses DataStore for data persistence. The application leverages Gson for serializing and deserializing complex data types like Workout and Goal into JSON strings.

## How Data is Stored:
### Gson Library:
- Converts Workout and Goal objects into JSON strings for storage.
- Converts JSON strings back into objects when retrieving data.
### DataStore:
- Stores the serialized JSON strings for workouts, goals, and user data.
- Ensures data is retained across app restarts.
### Gson Library Integration:
- Gson is used for its simplicity in handling JSON serialization and deserialization.
- This approach avoids the overhead of database setup, making it lightweight and efficient.
